 INSTALL
=========

RecSQL uses python's setuptools, and specifically, `easy_install`_

You can install to the latest version directly from the internet with
::

    easy_install -f http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/oliver/download/Python RecSQL

You can also download the source manually from
http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/oliver/download/Python and unpack
it. Install from the unpacked source with ::

    cd RecSQL-0.4
    python setup.py install

See the `easy_install`_ documentation for details, in particular if
you are interested in installing into non-standard locations.


Additional requirements are numpy_ and pysqlite_. `easy_install`_ will
automatically attempt to download appropriate versions if none are
currently installed.
