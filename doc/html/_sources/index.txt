=================================================
 RecSQL -- simple SQL analysis of python records
=================================================

RecSQL is a hack that allows one to load table-like data records into
an in-memory sqlite_ database for quick and dirty analysis via
SQL_. The :class:`~recsql.SQLarray` class has additional SQL functions
such as ``sqrt`` or ``histogram`` defined. SQL tables can always be
returned as `numpy record arrays`_ so that data can be easily handled in
other packages such as numpy_ or plotted via matplotlib_. Selections
produce new :class:`~recsql.SQLarray` objects.

Most of the Documentation_ is generated from the python doc
strings. Auto-generated `online source code documentation`_ is also
available. See :doc:`INSTALL` for installation instructions.

The package and the documentation are still in flux and any feedback,
bug reports, suggestions and contributions are very welcome. See the
package :doc:`README` for contact details.
