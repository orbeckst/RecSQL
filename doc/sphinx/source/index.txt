   contain the root `toctree` directive.

======================
 RecSQL documentation
======================

RecSQL is a hack that allows one to load table-like data records into
an in-memory sqlite_ database for quick and dirty analysis via
SQL_. Additional SQL functions such as sqrt or histograms are
defined. SQL tables can always be returned as numpy record arrays.

Most of the Documentation_ is generated from the python doc
strings. Auto-generated `online source code documentation`_ is also
available. See :doc:`INSTALL` for installation instructions.

The package and the documentation are still in flux and any feedback,
bug reports, suggestions and contributions are very welcome. See the
package :doc:`README` for contact details.
