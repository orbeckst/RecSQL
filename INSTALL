Typicall you can install from the unpacked source with ::

    python setup.py install

See the `easy_install`_ documentation for details.


You can install or update to the latest version directly from the
internet with ::

Additional requirements are numpy_ and pysqlite_. `easy_install`_ will
automatically attempt to download appropriate versiona if none are
currently installed.
